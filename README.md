# Archipelago Manager Backend
Backend client for Archipelago Manager, allowing for management of archipelago servers using a REST Api created using [FastAPI](https://github.com/fastapi/fastapi).

The idea is a backend that connects a client (frontend, discord bot, cli, etc.) to archipelago server nodes, with added functionality of management of servers, users, files etc.
